# wall-fractals
Code for creating very detailed pictures of some fractals

Each folder contains (the source code and) a Code::Blocks project file (http://www.codeblocks.org/).

To play with the code, download and install codeblocks (the version with mingw) from the site above, and then open the cbp file.

All code compiles as C++11 or later.
